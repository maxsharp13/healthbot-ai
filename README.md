# HealthBot

**HealthBot** is an AI-powered virtual assistant that helps users understand possible causes of their symptoms and suggests which type of doctor to contact.  
It’s not a diagnostic tool — just a helpful, friendly companion for basic health guidance.
This is my first attempt at combining my front end knowledge and javascript knowledge in to one webpage.
